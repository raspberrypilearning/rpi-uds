Ultrasonic Distance Sensors (UDS) are devices that measure distance by using ultrasonic waves. UDS can be used to detect the distance to an object and trigger actions based on proximity.

Ultrasonic sensors work by emitting ultrasonic waves from a transmitter. These waves travel through the air and reflect off objects, returning to the sensor's receiver. The sensor calculates the time it takes for the waves to return and uses this information to determine the distance to the object.

UDS can be used for various applications such as obstacle detection, measuring liquid levels, and creating interactive systems that respond to the presence and distance of objects. They are particularly useful in robotics, automation, and security systems.
